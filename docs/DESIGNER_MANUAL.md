WP Basic Bootstrap - Designers manual
=====================================

This manual is a documentation of how to use the *WP Basic Bootstrap* theme in your design work.

Before reading this document, you should begin by the [User Manual](USER_MANUAL.md), which presents the theme's structure
and a general usage for designers and users.


Assets & dependencies
---------------------

The assets of the theme are located in the `assets/` directory and the root directory for the common `scripts.js` and
`style.css`.

The assets dependencies are managed with [Bower](https://bower.io/) to always include the latest official version. This
way, when available, they do embed their `less` files you can edit to build your own versions.
