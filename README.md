WP Basic Bootstrap - A 101 Wordpress theme ready for modern web
===============================================================

Description
-----------

WP Basic Bootstrap is a full "101" [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) theme built with 
the [Bootstrap framework](http://getbootstrap.com/) and the [Font Awesome images font](http://fontawesome.io/), 
which implements all features of Wordpress version 4 and is ready to build a responsive 
and accessible blog or to be modified to build your own theme.

The theme is built using the Wordpress best practices: it supports all theme features such
as post formats, header and background customization and sticky posts, uses internal 
`filters` and `actions` to plug its rendering options, is ready for translations and its code follows the 
[Wordpress](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards) and [PSR](http://www.php-fig.org/) 
coding standards.

Many options are available in the admin panel's customizer, such as layout selection, 
template options, colors and fonts.

The theme can ba used out of the box but can also be a **robust and well-coded** basis
to build your own theme (see the license section of this file to learn about commercial
usage).
